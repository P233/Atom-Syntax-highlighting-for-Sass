# Syntax highlighting for Sass in Atom

This package is converted from the Sublime Text 2/3 [Syntax-highlighting-for-Sass](https://github.com/P233/Syntax-highlighting-for-Sass) package. For some reasons, completions haven't been converted. I'll make an update later.

**Note**: In order to make the syntax grammars defined by this package your defaults for `.sass` and `.scss` files, you must first disable the built-in [Language Sass package](https://github.com/atom/language-sass).

Please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/P233/Atom-Syntax-highlighting-for-Sass/issues/new) if you have any problems with this package or have any suggestions.
