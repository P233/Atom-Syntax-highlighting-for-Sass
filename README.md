# Syntax highlighting for Sass in Atom

This package is converted from the Sublime Text 2/3 [Syntax-highlighting-for-Sass](https://github.com/P233/Syntax-highlighting-for-Sass) package. For some reasons, completions haven't been converted. I'll make an update later.

Please feel free to [fill an issue](https://github.com/P233/Atom-Syntax-highlighting-for-Sass/issues/new) if you get any problem with this package or have any suggestions.
